IoT-based-icu-patient-monitoring-System

This project is an IoT-based ICU patient monitoring system.
It monitors patient vital signs such as oxygen level, blood pressure, and body temperature.
Doctors can log in to the system from anywhere and monitor patient conditions in real time.
If any parameter goes beyond the normal range, the system sends alerts to the doctor.
This helps doctors monitor patients even when they are not physically present in the hospital.
